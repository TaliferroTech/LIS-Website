    content="Author: Taliferro Group. At Taliferro Group, we recognize that a good Laboratory Information System (LIS) meets your needs and helps you to work more efficiently. It should allow you to organize your laboratory workflow, manage the results of samples, and create patient documents and billing documents easily while having an intuitive interface. The best LISs are modular, so they can be integrated with other applications such as CRM or e-commerce.">
